## Creating DenseNet Networks(DenseNet121, DenseNet169, DenseNet201 and DenseNet264) with Tensorflow
In this repository, we will look at how to create DenseNet architectures from scratch using Tensorflow.

#### Building an InceptionV1(GoogLeNet)

- InceptionV1(GoogLeNet) is a deep convolutional neural network that was proposed by Szegedy et al. This network won the ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge 2014 (ILSVRC-2014) where 92.3% classification performance was achieved. In particular, this model was designed in a special architecture that allows for increasing the depth and width of the network but keeping the computing resource.

- The VGG model has in total 22 layers and it is composed of 9 Inception blocks. 

- Although the InceptionV1(GoogLeNet) is complicated to implement, the parameter number of the whole model is not large. The Dense layers always take a majority of parameters. Besides, the appearance of the global average pooling layers helps to reduce significantly the parameter number, thus reducing the computational complexity of the model.

- The parameter number of this model is 6x smaller than the Alexnet model and much smaller than the VGG model. Especially, it outperforms these models.

I am trying to build this architecture of the GoogLeNet via tensorflow framework from scratch. More at the <a href= "https://github.com/makhmudjumanazarov/Inception-V1-GoogleNet-Architecture-via-Tensorflow/blob/main/Inception%20V1.ipynb">link below</a>...
